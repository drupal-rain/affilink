Affilink
========
It's a short name for Affiliate Link.
Utilize redirect.module and its redirect entity, create a bridge table 'affilink'
to connect an entity to a redirect link.
Then we could group a bundle of redirect links to an entity.

Current Status

By now only support auto parse link with <Entity Path>/goto/*.
